## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the **Road Accident Dashboard project!**

For this analysis, I've gathered a dataset from Kaggle that contains road accident information from the UK. This dataset comprises over **300,000** rows and includes critical data fields like

* Accident Date
* Severity 
* Light Conditions 
* Road Type and Surface 
* Number of Vehicles involved, and Casualties.

Using **Excel** as my primary tool, I've developed this informative dashboard. Within this dashboard, I visualize and explore the data to identify trends and connections, aiming to uncover factors contributing to accidents in the UK.

The primary goal of this project is to offer a user-friendly interface enabling stakeholders to quickly grasp key insights. This will helps to take informed decisions for **accident prevention and safety improvement on UK roads.**
