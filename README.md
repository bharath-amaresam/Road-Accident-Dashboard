## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the **Road Accident Dashboard project!**

For this analysis, I've gathered a dataset from Kaggle that contains road accident information from the UK. This dataset comprises over **300,000** rows and includes critical data fields like

* Accident Date
* Severity 
* Light Conditions 
* Road Type and Surface 
* Number of Vehicles involved, and Casualties.

Using **Excel** as my primary tool, I've developed this informative dashboard. Within this dashboard, I visualize and explore the data to identify trends and connections, aiming to uncover factors contributing to accidents in the UK.

The primary goal of this project is to offer a user-friendly interface enabling stakeholders to quickly grasp key insights. This will helps to take informed decisions for **accident prevention and safety improvement on UK roads.**

## KPI's

These are the primary and secondary KPI's i have represented in this Dashbaord

### Primary KPI's
*   **Total Casualties** taken place after the accident 
*   Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to **accident severity** and maximum casualties by **type of vehicle** 
### Secondary KPI's
*   Total Casualties with respect to **vehicle type** 
*   **Monthly trend** showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year 
*   Maximum casualties by **Road Type** 
*   Distribution of total casualties by **Road Surface** 
*   Relation between Casualties by **Area/ Location** & by **Day/ Night**

In conclusion, a comprehensive approach addressing urban risks, single carriageway concerns, road surface conditions, and different times of the day is vital for overall road safety improvement.
